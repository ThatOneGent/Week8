        <tr>
            <td>Great White Tomato</td>
            <td>Large Tomato that is fleshy but sweet</td>
            <td>Has a mild, fruity taste. Good producer, can get over a lb per fruit.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Spoon Tomato</td>
            <td>A very small tomato that grows in small groupings</td>
            <td>Size of a peppercorn. Bursts in mouth like boba. Huge hit.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cucamelon</td>
            <td>Mexican sour cucumber. Looks like a tiny little watermelon. Grows on a vine.</td>
            <td>Sour to sweet depending on when it's picked. Has great crunch. Eat whole.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Time Bomb Pepper</td>
            <td>Round pepper, low scoville count</td>
            <td>Not much taste or heat. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>White Currant Tomato</td>
            <td>Grape tomato that grow multiple on small vines. Lower in acid.</td>
            <td>Super sweet, and rich flavor. Will plant more than one plant this year.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chocolate Habanero</td>
            <td>Higher Scoville count than regular Habanero. Smokey flavor.</td>
            <td>A must each year. My favorite type of hot pepper. Perfect in chili to give it a smokey rich heat.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sweet Onion</td>
            <td>Sweet yellow onion used for cooking</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Brussel Sprouts</td>
            <td>Brussel Sprouts are brussel sprouts... </td>
            <td> Did not grow well at all, never really established.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Early Girl Tomato</td>
            <td>Classic tomato with consistent texture and flavor, ripens early</td>
            <td>Did well, but most rotted on the vine due to traveling.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Strawberries</td>
            <td>Strawberries are strawberries...</td>
            <td>Good success with a small basket planet in the greenhouse. Did not create large amounts of fruit, probably need more plants.</td>
